## What is Figma

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool for UI design and prototyping. It increases efficiency with the added flexibility of team libraries (the EDS) with components, styles and fonts automatically distributed.

**Platform agnostic**  
Figma is browser-based. It can also be downloaded as a stand-alone application for MacOS, Windows, Chromebook and Linux.

**Real-time collaboration**  
Figma allows you to edit along with your team, seeing what they are doing in real-time.

**Communication**  
Figma allows your team to leave contextual feedback by commenting directly in the design file.

**Prototyping**  
Figma allows you to quickly create and share your prototype with others for review or testing.

**Development**  
Figma allows your development team to always have view access to the current files and prototypes.


## Applying to use Figma

Continue using the same tools and processes as you have been. 
Still eager to prepare? Familiarise yourself with Figma - this will be your tool for designing and prototyping within the EDS. 
The Figma Organization licences will be available to use with the EDS once it is ready - more information on this will come later.

:warning: More information coming soon.

## Grids in Figma

* Change your nudge amount to 8px
    * :warning: Information coming soon on how to do that
* Make sure to read up on grids before starting with the EDS

## Clickbounds hidden by default

When starting to use Figma, you might wonder why some components, such as buttons, have a larger bounding box than visual presence. 
There is a layer called the clickbound, which is 48px in height. This is in accordance with the WCAG guidelines for touch targets and rounded up 4px to sit nicely on the 8-grid.

## Placeholders 

When putting together layouts, you can add a placeholder where you donâ€™t have content ready.

When the component is ready, simply replace the placeholder by dragging the component over the placeholder while holding down the shortcut described below.

- Mac: Ctrl + Apple key
- PC: Ctrl + Alt

:warning: GIF coming soon

## Finding components

* In the left sidebar, choose the tab **Assets**
    * :warning: Image example like: https://i.imgur.com/cyt9T1Q.png
* You can then scroll through the list to find the component, or you can use the search box. 
* Click and drag the component out to the frame you need it on.
* Do not change the colours or layouts.
