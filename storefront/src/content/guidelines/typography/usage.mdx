## Figma

### How to add
Assuming you have a text that you want to change the style for --- select the text, locate the "Text" section and click to open the style library (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components). The library contains a lot of styles in different sections. The sections "Headings" and "Paragraph" are the only ones relevant to most designers (the rest are nested inside components).


### How to use
Please see the Typography page (link to section) under for more information on available styles and when to apply which style.
