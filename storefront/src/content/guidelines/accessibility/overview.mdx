We firmly believe that all digital interfaces should be inclusive and accessible for everyone - regardless of impairments or abilities. 
Improving accessibility is not only the responsible thing to do, it also enhances the usability for all users. 
Please use this section as a guide to help ensure that your experiences meet or exceed the standards for accessibility. 


## What is accessibility?

Accessibility ensures that people of different abilities can understand, navigate, interact with and contribute to the digital interface in a meaningful way. 
This means: 
* Keyboard interaction alternatives for all mouse-based actions are provided. 
* All button and input fields are properly identified. 
* Images, SVGs and videos have text-based alternatives. 
* All components are built to convey their identity, operation model and state to assistive technologies. 


## What are different abilities?

There are many different types of abilities that need consideration. 

* Age  
* Blindness
* Low vision 
* Color-blindness 
* Hearing disabilities
* Physical disabilities
* Cognitive disabilities
* Situational disabilities (such as a broken arm)

There are also different types of situations that need consideration. 

* Physical location
* Limited screen size 
* Lighting issues


## Validating your work

The EDS is only a foundation for accessible design and development. 
Accessibility is the responsibility of the entire team - designers and developers have specific responsibilities listed in the related sections. 
Please familiarise yourself with the guidelines from [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and [Difi.no](https://uu.difi.no) to verify your interfaces meet the AA level requirements.

# Overview

Designing and building for accessibility means making sure that people with everyone, including people with disabilities can use the solutions we make. 

We strongly believe that all IT applications in Equinor should be accessible to anyone. "We treat everyone with fairness, respect and digniity." These words can be found in the [Equinor book](https://www.equinor.com/en/about-us.html#our-values) and they resonnate well with the accessibility guidelines in the Equinor Design System.

## General accessibility goals

* Enable projects utilising the EDS to deliver a good user experience to all users and across all devices.

* The code and design delivered will adhere to the global accessibility principles of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust.

## What kind of disabilities?

There are many disabilities that need to be considered, while vision and other physical disabilities are the most common. Although we design with these mind, other groups with temporary disabilities or environmental disabilites will also be considered. For example, limited screen size or lighting issues (too much or too little).

Designing for accessibility serves all these user groups and helps make a great user experience. 

## WCAG

The EDS is commited to following the [WCAG 2.0 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
