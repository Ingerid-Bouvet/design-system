:warning: Rough notes on how to use grids in Figma. 


# Grids in Figma

* First create a new frame in Figma. 
    * To do this, press `F` on your keyboard. 
    * You can then pick a frame size from the sidebar.

* Once you have a frame, you can apply a layout grid to the frame. 
    * To do this, select the frame you want to apply the grid to. 
    * In the sidebar next to Layout Grid, pick the 'Grid Styles' menu. This is the button with the 4 dots.
        * :warning: Image example like: https://i.imgur.com/n72ibxf.png 
    * The styles menu will open and you can choose the grid you need.
