Screen size is determined by the device and the user's window size. 
Our grid comes with three main content layouts that should cover all Desktop, Tablet and Mobile needs adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.
Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency across interfaces. 
 

## Grid layouts

It is the responsability of the designers to define a max width and choose the correct grid. 
It is the responsability of the developers to implement the max width and use the grid as designed. 

Tip:  
_Always remember to test designs and code by scaling the screen size or changing the orientation of the device._


## Grid influencers

When using a canvas Navigation Drawer or Sidesheet, the content container could be resized. 
This will sometimes require a smaller grid to be used.
