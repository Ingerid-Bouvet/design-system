## Figma

### How to add
Assuming you are starting from scratch---first, click `A` or `F`on your keyboard to open the predefined list of frame sizes (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components). Next, select the type of viewport you will use (Phone, Tablet, Desktop etc.), and select the frame preset needed (iPhone X, iPhone 8 etc.).

To change the grid layout, locate "Layout Grid". Open the style library (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and choose between Large, Medium and Small. You can only apply one grid at a time. To change grid, simply click the name of the grid and select a different grid layout.


### How to use
Please see the Grid overview for more information on available grid sizes and when to apply which grid style.
