## Figma

### How to add
Click `A` or `F`on the keyboard to open the predefined list of frame sizes (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components). Next, select the type of viewport needed (Phone, Tablet, Desktop etc.), and select the frame preset needed (iPhone X, iPhone 8 etc.).

To change the grid layout, locate "Layout Grid", open the style library (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and choose between Large, Medium and Small---only one gird can be applied at a time. To change grid, simply click the name of the grid and select a different grid layout.


### How to use
Please see the overview for more information on available grid sizes and when to apply which grid style.
