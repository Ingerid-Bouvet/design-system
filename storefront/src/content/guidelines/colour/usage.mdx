## Figma

### How to use
Assuming you have an element that you want to change the colour on---select the element, then under "Design", locate the "Fill" section and open the style library (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components). The library contains many styles in different sections, in order of relevance.


### How to use
Please see the Colour page (link to section) under Guidelines for more information on available styles and when to apply which style.
