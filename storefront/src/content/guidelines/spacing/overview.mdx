**Every part of your interface should be intentional -- this includes spacing. While spacing is invisible, it gives air and readability to your interface. Our spacing scale is based on 8px increments.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->


Spacing is used to apply `margin` and `padding` across all platforms. 
The EDS has a predefined set of spacers. These predefined sizes will ensure consistency across interfaces.  
The spacers `XX Small` and `X Small` are only to be used inside of components. 
While the spacers `Small` up to `XXX Large` can be used within components as well as between components.

- Always make sure to follow the [Accessibility Guidelines](link) by having 8px of spacing between each `clickbound`. 


## Spacing hierarchy

Less spacing between elements implies they relate to each other, while more space implies the opposite. 
More spacing around elements and content can help people with information processing. 
Too much information can be overwhelming if it is presented without spacing section after section. Allow people's eyes to rest. 

Less spacing around an element implies that it is not as important as an elements with more spacing around it. 
If you have a element that is very important consisder using more spacing around it. 


## Variations

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->


### Vertical spacing


There are 8 spacers to choose between: `XX small`, `X small`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `X large`, `XX large`, `XXX large`. The spacers `XX small` and `X small` are only to be used inside components while the other spacers are to used in layouts. 


### Horizontal spacing


There are 8 spacers to choose between: `XX small`, `X small`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `X large`, `XX large`, `XXX large`. The spacers `XX small` and `X small` are only to be used inside components while the other spacers are to used in layouts.
