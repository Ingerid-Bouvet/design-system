**Elevation is a visual effect that makes an element look like it's floating above the surface (using the z-axis).**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

The elevation effect is made using shadows to help lift an element into focus --- it is a reference to the physical world. Elements may be stacked on top of each other, but canâ€™t pass through each other.


### Not for: 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->


## Variations 


<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->
