# Elevation

Elevation is a visual effect that makes an element look like it's floating above the surface (using the z-axis). 
The effect is made using shadows to help lift an element into focus. 
It is a reference to the physical world. Elements may be stacked on top of each other, but canâ€™t pass through each other.

:warning: Will add use cases later - Need to see it in use more first.
