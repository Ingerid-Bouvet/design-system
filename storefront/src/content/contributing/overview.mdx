## Overview

The EDS has an overarching goal of creating consitent interface, experinces and being platform agnostic. The system serves the people using it - the designers and developers using it are the real customrs and are always to be at the center of the work when contributing to the system. If we were not to have them in mind we would do them a diservice to their users. 

Building such a system is no easy task. There are components to research, design, test, develop, pressure test, document, bugs to fix, questions to answer and maintenance to be done - just to name a few things.
