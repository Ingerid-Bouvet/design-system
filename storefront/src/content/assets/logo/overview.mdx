## Equinor Logo


### Internal interfaces

For internal interfaces, the Equinor logo is used in few places as users have already logged into the Equinor network. The prefered use of branding with the logo is via splash screens.


**Usage** 

* The logo can be used in `Energy Red`, `Black`or `White`. 
* Do not use the logo in `Energy Red` over a black background. 
* Do not use the logo over photography.
* For interfaces, only the horizonal logo is used. 
* Do not add any shadows, gradients, outlines, lighting effects, change the proportions, roatate or tilt the logo.
* Always use the logo spacing that is provided, this ensures the logo maintains its visual integrity. 
* The logo should not be used as a link in internal interfaces. This can cause confusion as the logo could be thought to link to equinor.com. 


### External use
