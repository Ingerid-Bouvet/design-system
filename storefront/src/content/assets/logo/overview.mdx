## Equinor Logo


### Internal interfaces

For internal interfaces, the Equinor logo is used in few places as users have already logged into the Equinor network. The prefered use of branding with the logo is via splash screens.


**Usage** 

* The logo can be used in `Energy Red` or `White`. 
* Do not use the logo in `Energy Red` over a black background. 
* Do not use the logo over photography.
* For interfaces, only the horizonal logo is used and it must have a minimum height of 48px.
* Do not add any shadows, gradients, outlines, lighting effects, change the proportions, roatate or tilt the logo.
* Always use the logo spacing that is provided, this ensures the logo maintains its visual integrity. 
* The logo should not be used as a link in internal interfaces. This can cause confusion as the logo could be thought to link to equinor.com. 


## Equinor star

The Equinor star can be used on splash screens and in animations. The Equinor star can not be used as an app icon, as it is used for the main Equinor app icon - all other apps should have unique icons. 


### Favicon
The favicon can be used at 16px or at 32px. The favicon can not be used in any other usecases than a favicon. 


## External use
