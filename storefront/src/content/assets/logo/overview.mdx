# Equinor Logo


## Using the logo 

### Internal interfaces

- Use only when necessary
- Use on splash screens
- Use minimally when used, small and not dominant. Not in top bar if possible. Never in sidebar. 

### External use

Please visit the [Brand Centre](link) (:warning: missing link) for more information about using the Equinor logo. 

### Colour and placement

The logo can be used in `Energy Red`, `Black`or `White`. Do not add any shadows, lighting effects, change the proportions or tilt the logo.  Always use the logo spacing that is provided, this ensures the logo maintains its visual integrity. 

### Logo as a link

The logo should not be used as a link in internal interfaces. This can cause confusion as the logo could be thought to go to equinor.com.
