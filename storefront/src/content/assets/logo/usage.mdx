### How to add
Select "Assets" (:warning: link to Figma page) and find logos by either scrolling to the Logos section or searching for logos. Add the logo you need by dragging it to your project.

### How to use
Logos can be resized, but remeber to hold shift in order to keep proportions. Also, refer to the relevant documentation for logo sizes etc.
