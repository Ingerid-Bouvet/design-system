Product icons communicate key themes and business areas in a clear, simple and branded style. They enhance visual communication, assist with navigation and reduce cognitive load. Product icons do not provide functional interaction---use system icons instead. 


## Origins

The EDS product icons are built on top of the [Equinor Brand Center's](https://communicationtoolbox.equinor.com/brandcenter/en/equinorbc/component/default/103 "Equinor Brand Center") guidelines for iconography.


## Usage

Product icons are used in app icons, app launchers and splash screens---always with the name of the product they represent. Product icons are not used for marketing or decoration. 


## Icon grid

Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying gird. The EDS icons are built on a 48x48px grid. Product icons can scale up, but not down, depending on context in the grid shape.


## Missing icons 

If you need additional icons, it is possible to create your own icons following the guidelines and sumbit them via contribution to the EDS. (:warning: Need contribution link)
