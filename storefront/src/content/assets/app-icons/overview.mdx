## Overview

Product icons communicate key themes and business areas in a clear, simple, branded style. They enhance visual communication, assist with navigation and reduce cognitive load. 


### Origins

The EDS product icons are built on top of the [Equinor Brand Center's](https://communicationtoolbox.equinor.com/brandcenter/en/equinorbc/component/default/103 "Equinor Brand Center") guideines for Iconography.

### Style

Our icons are constructed using simple keylines with no colour fill.
Rounded corners and lines. To reflect the rounded corners of our logo symbol icons have rounded corners and line ends.

These product icons do not provide functional interaction.
They can scale up or down depending on context. 
They always represent the Equinor brand and voice. 


### Missing icons 

If you need additional icons, it is possible to create your own icons following certain guidelines and sumbit them via contribution to the EDS. (:warning: Need contribution link)
