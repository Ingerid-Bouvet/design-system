## Overview

Product icons communicate key themes and business areas in a clear, simple, branded style. They enhance visual communication, assist with navigation and reduce cognitive load. Product icons do not provide functional interaction, use system icons instead. 


### Origins

The EDS product icons are built on top of the [Equinor Brand Center's](https://communicationtoolbox.equinor.com/brandcenter/en/equinorbc/component/default/103 "Equinor Brand Center") guideines for Iconography.


### Icon grid

Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying gird. The EDS icons are built on a 48 x 48 pixel grid. Product icons can scale up - but not down - depending on context in the grid shape circle, square, verticle rectangle and horizontal rectangle.


### Style

Our icons are constructed using simple single colour keylines with no colour fill. To reflect the rounded corners of the logo product icons have rounded corners and line ends.

Each icon has been reduced to its minimal form being bold, geometrical and symetrical. The EDS product icons are always faceing forward and never rotated or dimensional. The icons are made for legebility and are not too literal or complex, neither are they overly playfull or bubbly.


### Missing icons 

If you need additional icons, it is possible to create your own icons following certain guidelines and sumbit them via contribution to the EDS. (:warning: Need contribution link)
