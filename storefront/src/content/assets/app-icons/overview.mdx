## Overview

Product icons communicate key themes and business areas in a clear, simple, branded style. They enhance visual communication, assist with navigation and reduce cognitive load. Product icons do not provide functional interaction, use system icons instead. 


### Origins

The EDS product icons are built on top of the [Equinor Brand Center's](https://communicationtoolbox.equinor.com/brandcenter/en/equinorbc/component/default/103 "Equinor Brand Center") guideines for Iconography.


### Icon grid

Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying gird. The EDS icons are built on a 48 x 48 pixel grid. Product icons can scale up - but not down - depending on context in the grid shape circle, square, verticle rectangle and horizontal rectangle.


### Missing icons 

If you need additional icons, it is possible to create your own icons following certain guidelines and sumbit them via contribution to the EDS. (:warning: Need contribution link)
