## Design and production

Missing a system icon? You can make it following these simple guidelines. 

* All icons should be unique - so before you create a new one, make for sure that there is not an exsisting icon in the library under a different name. Search for keyword(s) assciated with the icon you are missing to ensure it is not already in the library. 
* All icon should be understandable regardless of language or location. 


## Style

Each icon has needs to be reduced to its minimal form being bold, geometrical and symetrical. To reflect the rounded corners of the logo, icons neeed to have rounded corners of 2 pixels where possible - however, interanl corners should be square, not rounded. To reflect the brand, icons use a consistent stroke of 2 pixels - this inculdes curves, angles and both interior and exterior strokes. The defualt icon is outline, a filled icon may be provided only if there is an outlined icon.

The EDS icons are always faceing forward and never rotated or dimensional. The icons are made for legebility and are not too literal or complex, neither are they overly playfull or bubbly.


**Exceptions**

Extreamly complex shapes sometimes require complex details. The guideilnes allow for subtle adjustments that help improve legibility of icons - these adjustments are refered to as **optical corrections**. This exception allow for use of 1.5 pixel internal or external strokes. If this can be avoided, it should be. 


## Making a new icon

* Create an artboard that is 24 x 24 pixels. 
  * Place the `.System icon grid`from the Utilites page in Assets in the background
  * Choose the grid shape circle, square, verticle rectangle or horizontal rectangle.
  * Lock the grid layer and start to build your icon.
  * Make sure to align all artwork to the pixel grid.
  * :warning: Examples of grid coming soon
* Never use center borders - centering can cause half pixels. 
* Avoid using the line tool, use the rectangle tool - the line tool will align to half pixels. 
* If you end up using borders or the line tool - which is not recommended - make 100% for sure to outline (expand) your work. 


## Submitting your new icon

* When your icon has been created, delete the `.System icon grid` layer that you had locked.
* Make sure your icon is not grouped or nested. 
* Make sure all your layers are named logically. 
* Make sure to name the icon what it is - avoid interperative names that will make the icon hard to search and find. 
  * If you make a filled icon to suplement the outlined icon, both icons need to have this stated in their name. For example, `add circle filled` and `add circle outlined`
* Pick a category for the icon to live under. Refernce the library for current categories.
* :warning: More information to come about submitting process.
