## Overview

System icons enhance interfaces by adding visual communication to actions, status and feedback while reducing cognitive load. They are to provide meaning at a glance. 


### Origins 
The EDS system icons are built on a copy of the outlined [GMD icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=round) provided open-source by Google. The icons have been customised and renamed for Equinor's use. 


### Icon grid

Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying grid. The EDS icons are built on a 24x24 pixel grid. System icons can be used in 16px and 24px sizes. 


### Missing icons

If you need additional icons, it is possible to create your own icons following certain guidelines and submit them via contribution to the EDS. (:warning: Need contribution link)
