## Overview

System icons enhance interfaces by adding visual communication to actions, status, and feedback while reducing cognitive load. They are to provide meaning at a glance. 


### Origins 
The EDS system icons are built on a _fork_ of the rounded [GMD icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=round) provided open-source by Google. The icons have been customized for Equinor's use. 


### Icon grid

Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying gird. The EDS icons are built on a 24 x 24 pixel grid. System icons can be used in 16px and 24px sizes in the shape circle, square, verticle rectangle and horizontal rectangle. 


### Style 

Each icon has been reduced to its minimal form being bold, geometrical and symetrical. To reflect the rounded corners of the logo, icons have rounded corners of 2 pixels where possible. To reflect the brand, icons use a consistent stroke of 2 pixels - this inculdes curves, angles and both interior and exterior strokes. The defualt icon is outline, a filled icon may be provided only if there is an outlined icon.

The EDS icons are always faceing forward and never rotated or dimensional. The icons are made for legebility and are not too literal or complex, neither are they overly playfull or bubbly. 


### Missing icons

If you need additional icons, it is possible to create your own icons following certain guidelines and sumbit them via contribution to the EDS. (:warning: Need contribution link)
