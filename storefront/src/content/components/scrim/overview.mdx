**A scrim is a temporary visual effect that fades the general interface, allowing the user to focus on an overlay.**

***

## Guidelines

Always use a scrim with an overlay component such as a Dialog, Elevated Sidesheet or Elevated Navigation Drawer (mobile only).

## Interactions

When the scrim is clicked on or the `ESC` key is pressed --- the overlaid component will close, closing the scrim with it.
