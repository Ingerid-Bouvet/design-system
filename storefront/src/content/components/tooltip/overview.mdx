**Ingress**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->
**A tooltip is shown when hovered, focused or long-pressed (touch) that displays information such as a text label or a short decription.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Tooltips disappear after the mouse is no longer hovering the target area, the focus has moved on or the long-press has been released. The information they provide should be very short and descriptive. Tooltips are great to help explain icon meanings and help describe differences between similar components. 

Tooltips should aim to have a single line of text, that does not wrap keeping the text under 80 characters in length. The position of the tooltip is flexible. When tooltips are used on components at the edge of the frame, make sure to align them to be visable and not become cropped. They are always pointed to the component to which they give information about.


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use tooltips that restate visible UI text.
* Do not add tooltips to buttons with text.
