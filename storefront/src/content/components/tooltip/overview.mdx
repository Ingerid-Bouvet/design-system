**Ingress**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->
A tooltip is shown when hovered, focused or long-pressed (touch) that displays information such as a text label or a short decription.

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Tooltips disappear after the mouse is no longer hovering the target area, the focus has moved on or the long-press has been released. They are always paird with an component to interact with. The information they provide should be very short and descriptive. Tooltips are great to help explain icon meaning and help descripe differences between similar components. 

Tooltips should have a single line of text, that does not wrap. Aim to keep the tooltip under 80 characters in length. The position of the tooltip is flexible. When tooltips are used on components at the edge of the frame, make sure to align them to be visable and not become cropped. 


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use tooltips that restate visible UI text.
* Do not add tooltips to buttons with text. 
* Do not add rich information, such as bold or italics.
* Do not add images, such as avatars or icons.
* Do not move tooltips to follow the cursor.
* Do not have over 2 lines of text in a tooltip.
