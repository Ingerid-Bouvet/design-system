**A card displays content related to a single subject and acts as an entry point to more detailed information. Card blocks can be combined in a variety of ways.**

***

## Guidelines

The `card/container` itself is the only required block in a card. Cards align to the grid columns, so their width is fluid.
However content blocks within the card sit within the container's own grid. There are four avaliable `card/container` options: `default`, `info`, `danger`and `warning`.


## Content


### Title


There are twelve title block to choose between: `Avatar H6 caption`, `Avatar H6 caption action`, `Overline H6`, `Overline H6 action`, `Overline H6 avatar`, `H4 body short`, `H4 body short action`, `H4 body short avatar`, `H5 body short`, `H5 body short action` and `H5 body short avatar`.


Title blocks can have: 
* Title
* Subtitle
* Avatar
* Metadata
  * Tags, badges and free text
* Overflow menu


### Supporting text

There are two supporting text blocks to choose between: `supporting-text/middle` which is to be used when it is sandwiched inbetween other blocks and `supporting-text/last` which is to be used when it is the last block. 

Supporting text blocks can have: 
* Supporting text
  * Should not contain multiple paragraphs
  * Use inline links with high caution


### Rich media

There are three rich media blocks to choose between: `rich-media/middle` which is to be used when it is sandwiched inbetween other blocks, `rich-media/last` which is to be used when it is the last block and `rich-media/leading-image` which is to be used when it is the first block. The `rich-media/middle` and `rich-media/last` blocks are placeholder blocks, meaning that you can add your own rich content to them. 


Rich media blocks can have: 
* Graph
* Table
* Image
  * within the gird when between blocks and full width when leading
* Dividers


### Actions

There are three action blocks to choose between: `actions/buttons`, `actions/icons` and `actions/meta`.

Action blocks can have: 
* Supplemental actions
* Dividers
  * Content that can be expanded should use full-width dividers, ignoring the horizontal spacing.
* Overflow menu
* UI controls
* Chips


### Cards are not for: 
* Top bars
* Sidesheets
* Nav drawers
* Lists
* Nested cards
* Galleries
