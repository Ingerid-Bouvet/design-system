>> A card displays content related to a single subject and acts as an entry point to more detailed information. Card blocks can be combined in a variety of ways to accomplish thier use case. 


## Guidelines

The `card/container` itself is the only required block in a card. Cards align to the grid columns, so their width is fluid.
However content blocks within the card sit within the grid. There are four avaliable `card/container` options: `default`, `info`, `danger`and `warning`.
