### How to add
First of all, assembling a card is a process of a few steps and not always straight forward.  A card is put together by a set of components, almost like Lego. Start by adding the minimum - the container. Select "Assets" (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and locate the cards either by scrolling to the "Cards" section or searching for "cards". Choose an appropriate containter from the "Container" section. The different components of the card can then be added from the other sections under "Cards".


### How to use
First of all, make sure the container is aligned with the grid layout. Toggle the grid layout on by using the following shortcut:

Mac: `Control` + `G`
PC: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `4`

Align the card to fit within the grid columns needed. When adding new card components to the card, make sure their width is aligned with the card container's inline grid (except "Leading image" in the "Rich media" section, which should always be full card width).
