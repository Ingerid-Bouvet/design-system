### How to add
Assembling a card is a process of a few steps and is put together by a set of sub-set of components, almost like Lego. Start by adding the minimum - the container. Select "Assets" (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and locate the cards either by scrolling to the "Cards" section or searching for "Cards". Choose a "Container", then add the different components of the card needed.


### How to use
It is important to make sure the container is aligned with the grid layout. Toggle the grid layout on/off by using the following shortcut:

Mac: `Control` + `G`
PC: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `4`

Align the card to fit within the grid columns needed. When adding new card components to the card, make sure their width is aligned with the card container's inline grid.

* The `Rich media/Leading image` is to be full bleed / full width and ignores the cards innner grid. 
* All `Title` and `Action` blocks are only to be resized in width, not height.
