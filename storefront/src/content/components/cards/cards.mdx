## Overview


A card displays content related to a single subject and acts as an entry point to more detailed information. 
A card is made of 3 sections: header, content and footer. The content section can accommodate many layout types. 


## Usage

The card container itself is the only required block in a card. 
Cards align to the grid columns, so their width is fluid.
