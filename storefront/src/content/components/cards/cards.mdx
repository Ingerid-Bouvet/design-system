## Overview


A card can display content related to a single subject and axct as an entry point to more detailed information. 
A card is made of 3 sections: header, content and footer. The content section can accommodate many layout types. 
A card must have a header with the title - however, the body and footer is optional

Cards align to the grid columns, so their width is fluid.
