## Link vs. Button

A button is used when performing an action. Actions are almost always on the same page. A link is used when navigating to another place. Links may change what or how data is displayed (for example, "See all"). If the action will change the data, use a button. 


## Usage

- Links should be less than 3 words
- Avoid terms like "Click here", instead use meaningful labels for the link that match the desstination. 
- Use links in body text, ordered and unordered lists


**Exceptions**

The link style can be used without the underline when it is paired with an icon that implies interaction or when it causes uncesessary visual clutter. This does not meet all the accessility guidelines but sometimes is more useful to not overload visually.
