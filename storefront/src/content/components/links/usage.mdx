## Figma

### How to add

To indicate that a text string is a link, you need to add underline and a proper colour. To underline the text, select the text and locate the "Text" section. From here you click the overflow menu and locate the underline button (which is an underlined U). To add the proper colour to the same text, locate the "Fill" section, open the style library (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and find the sections that start with "Interactive".


### How to use
Please see the Links overview for more information on when to apply which link style.
