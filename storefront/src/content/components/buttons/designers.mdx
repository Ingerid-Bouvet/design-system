This will be the same for finding all compoennts in Figma. Rebecca, Should we just have a section in getting started on how to find components. Then we dont need to repeat ourselves 100x and can write here about Figma only if there is something 'strange' about the component in Figma that needs to be pointed out.

* You can then scroll to find Buttons or search for them. 
* Once you have found it, click and drag it out to the Frame you need it on.
* Do not change the colors or layouts. 
	* Only edit the Button text.

The EDS has Primary, Secondary and Danger buttons avaliable in the Contained, Outlined and Text variations. All variations can have an icon on the right, left, only an icon with no text and only text. When using an icon, it must be directly related to the action and label of the button. 


### Contained buttons

Do not used two contained buttons next to each other. When grouping, use a outlined or text button with a contained button.

### Buttons with a left or right icon
Buttons can used an icon to help clarify an action. Always use icons that clearly communicate their meanings. 


## Button width

Buttons have a minimum padding that is automatically built into the component. You can however strech the buttom to span one or multiple columns in width. 


## Button labels
