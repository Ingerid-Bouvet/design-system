# Designers


<!-- 
This will be the same for finding all compoennts in Figma. Rebecca, Should we just have a section in getting started on how to find components. Then we dont need to repeat ourselves 100x and can write here about Figma only if there is something 'strange' about the component in Figma that needs to be pointed out. 
-->

## Buttons in Figma

* In the left sidebar, choose the tab Assets
    * :warning: Image example like: https://i.imgur.com/cyt9T1Q.png
* You can then scroll to find Buttons or search for them. 
* Once you have found it, click and drag it out to the Frame you need it on.
* Do not change the colors or layouts. 
	* Only edit the Button text. 
	* If using a Button with an icon, replace the `Icon Placeholder` with the icon needed.
